# Advent of Code 2023

All of the answers were written and run once. I did not make any attempt to optimize, comment, or pretty up the code. This means plenty of strange variable names, byzantine if-then blocks, and so on. No AI coding tools were used. Most of the code was copied directly from the Python REPL after I got a correct answer.

I avoided brute force solutions where possible. Each function produces a valid answer in a reasonable amount of time (<2 seconds or thereabouts.)
