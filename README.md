# Advent of Code 2023

All of the answers were written and run once. I did not make any attempt to optimize, comment, or pretty up the code. This means plenty of odd variable names, long if-then blocks, and so on. I ignored edge cases where allowed by the input.

I did not use any AI coding tools or assistance. I attempted to use only standard library Python written and executed directly in the Terminal (with the notable exception of the least common multiple problem, where I used NumPy.)

I avoided brute force solutions where possible. Each function produces a valid answer in a reasonable amount of time (<2 seconds or thereabouts.)
